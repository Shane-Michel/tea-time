# 🌿 Tea Time Bible Study

*A quiet daily Bible study ritual created by Shane & Vicki Michel.*

## ✨ Overview

Tea Time is a warm, devotional, Scripture-centered web app built for
daily Bible study. Designed for Shane and Vicki's morning and evening
tea ritual, the site is also made publicly accessible for anyone who
wants guided studies, Scripture insights, and a peaceful place to
reflect.

Tea Time focuses on slowing down, reading God's Word, and understanding
how to apply Scripture to everyday life. Studies progress over multiple
days and include reflection opportunities, personal notes, and user
accounts.

The first studies include:

-   **The Gospel of Matthew**\
-   **The Book of Esther**\
-   **Fasting (Topical Study)**

More studies can be added easily and dynamically over time.
